# Introduction To Python
Python is a general purpose high level programming Language.
It was designed for simplicity, readability, versatility. 
Python is an object-oriented language, meaning that we can create an object in 
python (such as a car) to mimic real life object hiding/encapsulating their properties to allow developers 
interact with them easily. 
Think of how an Electrical Engineer uses a resistor with out really concerning himself with all the details of the resistor.
Or how you would drive a car without worry so much on how the engine was build. This component haave been encapsulated all you need to
do is drive the car.

Python also is an interpreted language. Meaning that the source code is translated line by line by the interpreter at run time.

# Who created Python
Python was created by Guido van Rossum.

# Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
The name "Python" comes from Guido van Rossum's fondness for Monty Python's Flying Circus, a British comedy group.

# What is the Zen of Python

It emphasizes readability and simplicity.

# How to use the Python interpreter
To use the Python interpreter, open a terminal and type python or python3 followed by your Python code.

# Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle
The official Python coding style is described in PEP 8. You can check your code for style compliance using `pycodestyle`

``
pycodestyle file_name.py
``
# Python Scripts
Python script should begin with
``
#!/usr/bin/python3
``
# Shell  Script
